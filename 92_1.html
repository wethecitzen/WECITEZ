		Every leader in Andhra Pradesh is testing his/her luck to get either MP or MLA ticket. Generally the competition will be severe in the party which is in ruling. Already there are hundreds of contenders waiting for a chance and call from TDP high command.</p>

<p>
But a new headache has arrived for the Telugu Desam in the form of government officials. Officers who holding key positions in important departments and even retired officers are keen to contest on the cycle symbol. Accordingly they are making their moves as well. Few are doing social service independently and trying get an eye of TDP boss through word of mouth while others are indulging in lobbying.
</p>
<p>
Many of the officers are said to be working in the chief minister's office. As part of their service, they had got closed to the TDP by doing things which can impress the CM and as per sources, few of them already expressed their willingness to take VRS and join TDP and if given a chance, are ready for the poll battle.
</p>
<p>
A retired higher officer from information department who is still working on extension has started his bit of convincing Chandrababu Naidu. He wants to contest for Bapatla Parliament seat. If that's not allotted, he wants to contest for assembly from Kurnool. He also maintains cordial relations with Babu and Lokesh. However, the very official had contacts with YSRCP and TDP leaders have negative vibes about him.
</p>
<p>
Another official from protocol department has laid his eyes on Nellore's Udayagiri assembly segment. Instead of approaching TDP boss directly, he is doing social work through a trust and making sure his work is reaching the CM. At least in this way, this officer wants to snap a ticket.
</p>
<p>
There are officials from electricity and income tax departments. But it's all Chandrababu's call whom to field in the polls. For sure he would favour for people who have worked for the party right from the beginning and the experienced ones.
