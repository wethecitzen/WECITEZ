<p>"He now knows you can't rule India by dividing people," he said in his speech in Hindi.</p>

<p>"The image of Narendra Modi is finished," Mr Gandhi declared.</p>

<p>He alleged that the RSS was attempting to capture institutions, from the judiciary to the Election Commission.</p>

<p>"We have not merely formed governments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh... we will ensure that RSS people put in institutions in these states are removed," he said.</p>

<p>The Congress chief also alleged that while China sent its army to Doklam, the prime minister flew to China and held a summit without an agenda.</p>
