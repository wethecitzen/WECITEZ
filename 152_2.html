	Pulwama terror attack: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that those who have targeted India and attacked the CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir will have to pay a heavy price. Speaking at a train inauguration event in Delhi, he said the neighbour (Pakistan) thinks that terror attacks can weaken India, but they will not be successful.
</p>
<p>
“My condolences to families of those martyred in Pulwama attack, those behind the terror strike will be punished,” Modi said and and urged the world to come together to crush terrorism.
</p>
<p>
PM also said that Indian security forces have been given a free hand to reply. “Security forces have been given complete freedom, the blood of the people is boiling,” Modi said.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Security met on Friday morning to discuss the security scenario in the state in the wake of terror attack.
</p>
<p>
India on Thursday slammed Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and asked the neighbouring country to stop supporting terrorists and dismantle terror infrastructure operating from its soil.
</p>
<p>
India also strongly reiterated its appeal to all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan.
</p>
<p>
In one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir’s three decades of militancy, a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district on Thursday, killing over 40 personnel and leaving many critically wounded. The Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack that took place about 20 km from Srinagar.
