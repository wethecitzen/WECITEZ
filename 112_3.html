     <b> Lucknow: </b>The Uttar Pradesh secondary education department is yet to keep a check on the menace of cheating during examination by implementing the orders of the state government. So far no arrangements have been made in this regard. A special computerised room will soon be set up to monitor the CCTV footage and the voice recordings set up at the exam centres during the board exam period. Notably, the Uttar Pradesh board exams began on February 7.

<p>
The state government has ordered the secondary education board to arrange for the control room which will be made operational from February 12 onwards, said education department officials. District inspector of schools (DIOS) Ravindra Kumar was quoted by Times of India as saying, “The control room will be established at the government inter college in Shahganj by February 12 when the main exams begin. The control room will have six computers and employees will be assigned duty in two shifts.”

Kumar added that the superintendents of the examination centres will monitor the CCTV footage and voice recordings on a daily basis. On February 7, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma conducted a surprise inspection at Navyug Kanya Vidyalaya in Rajendra Nagar as high school and intermediate examinations of the UP Board began, stated news agency ANI. Dinesh Sharma reportedly said that about 1,314 examination centres were categorised as sensitive, while 448 examination centres were considered to be hyper-sensitive.

This year, a total of 58,06,922 students are taking up the exams. As many as 8,354 schools are made into exam centres.
