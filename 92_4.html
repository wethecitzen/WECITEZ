		Tollywood star young tiger NTR had hosted the popular reality show Bigg Boss Telugu season one in the year 2017 and it turned out to be an instant hit. The TRPs of this show had  breaking some records as well. However, the star could not take up season two as he was busy with his acting assignments. The offer then went to Nani who successfully hosted season 2.
</p>
<p>
Now, with season three on cards, there were expectations on who would be hosting the show. Well, reports are that Jr NTR is back! The star has agreed to be back on Bigg Boss for this season and has been paid a whopping Rs 2 crore for it.
</p>
<p>
In fact, when he hosted season one, Jr NTR made an astounding Rs 35 lakh per episode which was much higher than what his seniors like Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna were paid for hosting television shows.
</p>
<p>
Jr NTR is currently busy with the Telugu multi starrer RRR, which is beign directed by SS Rajamouli. The shooting of this film commenced a couple of months ago and is  under progress. It will go on for the next few months and is slated to hit the silver screens for Sankaranthi 2020.

<p>
RRR stars two of Tollywoodâ€™s top stars Ram Charan Teja and Jr. NTR in the lead roles. While Jr NTR will be sporting a bulky look with beard, Ram Charan will be seen in a completely new hairstyle. A top hairstylist has been brought in to work on it. Massive and extravagant sets have been erected for shooting the fight scenes and it is progressing well. RRR is being made on a budget of Rs 300 crore, we hear. Veteran musician MM Keeravani will be composing the tunes</p>
