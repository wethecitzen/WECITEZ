		<b>Chennai: </b>Over two lakh BJP cadres from eight Lok Sabha constituencies in Tamilnadu will attend a public rally by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Tirupur tomorrow, said Sate unit general secretary of the party Vanathi Srinivasan.</p>

<p>
Speaking to News Today over phone, Vanathi, said, “Narendra Modi will attend a public meeting at Tirupur Grounds tomorrow at 2 pm. He will highlight the achievements of NDA government for the past five years and the various welfare measures initiated for Tamilnadu.”
</p>
<p>
Cadres from Nilgiris, Pollachi, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Namakkal and Karur will attend the meet, she said and added, “Union Ministers Piyush Goel, Pon Radhakrishnan and State BJP office-bearers will attend the meeting.”
</p>
<p>
Denying reports that Modi will formalise alliance in Tamilnadu ahead of the general elections, Vanathi Srinivasan, said, “He will highlight the various welfare measures initiated for the State.”

</p>
<p>

It will give us the necessary impetus to reach out to the public. Cadres will be enthused, she added.
Stating that BJP has a strong presence in the region, she recalled that in the last Assembly elections they managed 10 per cent votes from these eight constituencies.
</p>
<p>
“And we came second in Pollachi and Coimbatore Lok Sabha seats pushing DMK to third position.”
</p>
<p>
“Various concessions given to MSMEs in this region, reduction of GST on knitwear industry from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, sops for agriculturists and development of rail and air routes from these regions to various other places would be highlighted by Modi,” she added.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Tirupur is wearing a festive look ahead of Modi’s visit. Banners and festoons have been erected at many places. Police have deployed men in khakhi in large number and strict vigil is being maintained.</p>
