NEW DELHI:
Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has to 

reimburse the public money spent on installing elephant statues, her party symbol, in Lucknow and Noida, the 
Supreme Court said today.
</p></STRONG>
<p>
The top court was hearing a petition filed by an advocate who had contended that public money cannot be utilised for creating own statues and for propagating the political party.
</p>
<p>
"We are of the tentative view that Mayawati has to deposit the public money spent on her statues and party symbol to the state exchequer," a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said.
</p>
<p>
The bench, also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjeev Khanna, will hear the case next on April 2.
</p>
<p>
The court made it clear the tentative view was expressed by it as the matter will take some time for hearing.
</p>
<p>
"We will have it for final disposal on April 2," the Supreme Court said.
</p>
<p>
COMMENT
The BSP's lawyer, Satish Mishra, asked the court if the case can be heard in May, after the national election.
